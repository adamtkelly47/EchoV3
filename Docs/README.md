# Echo

## What Echo Is

Echo is a private personal AI operating system — a conversational assistant, decision-support platform, research platform, orchestration platform, memory system, and planning partner. It reads real personal data (portfolio, calendar, email, research) through authorized integrations, performs deterministic calculations in code, conducts attributable research, and proposes consequential actions for human approval. It does not autonomously execute them.

## What Echo Is Not

A generic chatbot wrapper, a collection of disconnected agents, a system where a language model invents calculations or executes writes on its own authority, a dashboard that just displays raw API data, a financial trading bot, or an autonomous decision maker. See CONSTITUTION.md's Product Definition for the full list.

## Current Phase

**Phase 7 — Model gateway.** Phases 0-6 (governing documents, Docker foundation, quality/CI, core runtime contracts, database foundation, capability registry, approval engine) are complete. Phase 7 adds `providers/models/`: a common `ModelRequest`/`ModelResponse` contract, real Claude and Ollama adapters (provider SDK objects never escape the adapter), a deterministic escalation policy, verified per-token Claude pricing, and a `ModelGateway` that switches providers through configuration, never prompt wording or model self-selection. Do not begin Phase 8 without explicit instruction.

(Per an explicit standing instruction, phases are being completed and committed continuously without waiting for a go-ahead between each — see `DECISION_LOG.md`'s 2026-07-21 entries.)

## How to Read These Docs

Start with `CONSTITUTION.md` — it is the highest authority in the repository and everything else elaborates on it, never overrides it. Then:

1. `DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP.md` — who owns what business concept (constitutionally binding).
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the concrete repository structure and dependency rules.
3. `REQUEST_LIFECYCLE.md` — how a request moves through the system end to end.
4. `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` — how executable behavior is registered and discovered.
5. `APPROVAL_MODEL.md` — the approval state machine gating every consequential write.
6. `DATA_MODEL.md` — conceptual state ownership and the provenance model.
7. `MODEL_ROUTING.md` — the Ollama/Claude/deterministic-code division of labor.
8. `DOMAIN_EVENTS.md` — the cross-domain event catalog.
9. `SECURITY.md` — security requirements, binding from the phase each surface first exists.
10. `TESTING.md` — the testing pyramid and mechanically enforced coding standards.
11. `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the phase workflow every implementation phase follows.
12. `decisions/ADR_000N_*.md` — the architecture decisions already made and why.
13. `DECISION_LOG.md` — chronological index of material decisions, including ones not yet worth a full ADR.
14. `OPERATIONS.md` — how to run the local environment and handle secrets.

If implementation ever appears to disagree with these documents, the documents win unless superseded by an approved ADR (CONSTITUTION.md's Constitutional Status).

## Repository Map

Docs/decisions/        # architecture decision records
echo/                  # Python: apps/api, apps/worker, apps/scheduler (shared codebase, ADR_0001)

```

`echo/core`, `echo/domains`, `echo/providers`, `echo/infrastructure`, `echo/api`, `echo/tests`, `echo/migrations` are defined conceptually in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and do not exist yet — they are created starting Phase 3, one vertical slice at a time.

## How to Run the System / How to Run Tests

See `OPERATIONS.md` for the one-command startup, verification steps, and secret handling conventions. There is no test suite yet — automated testing tooling is a Phase 2 deliverable.

## PROMPT.md

`PROMPT.md` is the original build specification this repository implements, organized into 29 phases. It is a source input, not itself governing documentation — where it conflicts with `CONSTITUTION.md` or `DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP.md`, those take precedence and the conflict is recorded as an ADR (see `Docs/decisions/ADR_0005_domain_catalog_reconciliation.md` for the first example).
